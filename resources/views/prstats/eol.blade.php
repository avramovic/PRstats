        <h4>PRStats will become part of the official RealityMod site!</h4>
        <section>
            <p>The previous message got you scared, right? üòÅ</p>
            <p>I'm happy to announce that I was contacted by developers of the game and we not only agreed to, but already transferred the site to
                <a href="https://prstats.realitymod.com" target="_blank">https://prstats.realitymod.com</a>! <code>\o/</code></p>
            <p>We had to get rid of those awesome avatars as there was hundreds of thousands of them and hosting costs have skyrocketed recently. But they might be back in some other form in the future.</p>
            <p>This site will continue operating for a little while and then I'll force redirection to the site linked above.</p>
            <p>Cheers,<br />Sgt. Baker</p>

        <section>
            <p>After 7 years (with a couple of breaks) of running this website, it's time to say goodbye.</p>
            <p>Since taking a new role on my job I really don't have time to play games nor to continue maintaining this website. I didn't have too much time to play before either (check <a href="/sgt-baker" target="_blank">my stats</a> and when was the last time I was playing), but I did play from time to time and I had enthusiasm to maintain this website, if nothing else, then to see my stats update after I finish playing. But now when I don't even play this awesome game anymore, it's not really fun to keep maintaining this website.</p>
            <p>The domain name will expire on <strong>2024-05-03</strong> and I don't plan to renew it. Once it expires, I will shut down the background services used to gather data and generate avatars/signatures.</p>
            <p>If anyone is willing to take over the hosting and maintenance of this website, hit me up on avramyu <em>at</em> gmail <em>dot</em> com before the date stated above. The stack used is PHP (Laravel) with MySQL database, and AWS is used for static file hosting (S3) and background task processing (SQS).</p>
            <p>Thank you all for being part of this, but it's time to focus on other things in life.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
